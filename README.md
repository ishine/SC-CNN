# SC-CNN : Effective Speaker Conditioning Method for Zero-Shot Multi-Speaker Text-to-Speech Systems
<p align="center"><img src="SC-CNN.jpg" width="60%"></p>

Thanks to [StyleSpeech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03153), we built up our codes based on [Link](https://github.com/KevinMIN95/StyleSpeech)

0. [LibriTTS]((https://research.google/tools/datasets/libri-tts/)) dataset (train-clean-100 and train-clean-360) is used.
1. Sampling rate is set to 16000Hz.
2. This is the implementation of `SC-StyleSpeech`. <br>For SC-TransferTTS, please refer to the branch `SC-TransferTTS`

## Materials
- [Demo page](https://hcy71o.github.io/SC-CNN-demo/)

## Prerequisites
- Clone this repository.
- Install python requirements. Please refer [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)

## Preparing
0. Run 
```
python prepare_align.py --data_path [LibriTTS DATAPATH]
```
for some preparations.
1. [Montreal Forced Aligner](https://montreal-forced-aligner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (MFA) is used to obtain the alignments between the utterances and the phoneme sequences. 
1-1. Download MFA following the command in the website.
1-2. Run the below codes
```
$ conda activate aligner
$ mfa model download acoustic english_mfa
$ mfa align ......LibriTTS/wav16 lexicon.txt english_us_arpa .........LibriTTS/Textgrid
```
2. Run 
```
python preprocess.py
```
2-0. Check input&output data paths.

## Training
```
python train.py
```
0. Change default settings  --data_path [Preprocessed LibriTTS DATAPATH] --save_path [Experiment SAVEPATH]
1. You can change hyperparameters of SC-CNN (kernel_size, channels), or other model configurations in configs/config.json

## Inference
0. Mel generation
```
python synthesize.py --checkpoint_path [CKPT PATH] --ref_audio [REF AUDIO PATH] --text [INPUT TEXT]
```
